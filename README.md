# Trimmed k-means clustering algorithm

Simple shiny app to visualize several datasets and the trimmed k-means algorithm. Application is hosted here: <a href="https://baldvine.shinyapps.io/trimmedKmeans/" target="_blank">https://baldvine.shinyapps.io/trimmedKmeans/</a>

The default dataset is the ruspini dataset (from the *cluster* package), which has 4 distinct clusters. There are multiple data sets to choose from. 

Note that the method has a random aspect to it. See <a href="https://github.com/baldvine/initializeKmeans/" target="_blank">https://github.com/baldvine/initializeKmeans/</a> for several methods to initialize the standard k-means algorithm.
